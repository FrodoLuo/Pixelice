## How to start this project
Make sure Node.js was installed on your platform\
You can get Node from *[HERE](http://nodejs.cn/)*

```shell
npm install

# if the installation is slow, try the next two commands
# 
# cnpm install

# And then type the below command
npm run start
```
## note there may be several problems:
- The server is poor, loading may be really slow.
- You may encount errors on the homepage, and the browser console tells several errors like 'cannot read length of undefined'; Then try the next few steps:
  1. Access the api manually
      - for example access: http://localhost/api/photo/getHotPhotos
  2. Refresh the page.
  3. If there is still something wrong, call me on QQ.

## AND I HOPE YOU READ SOME ABOUT **REACT** TO WORK WITH THE HOMEWORK.
